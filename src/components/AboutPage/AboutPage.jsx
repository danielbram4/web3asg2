            Welcome to our project! This single-page application is crafted with React and Vite,
            delivering a seamless and interactive user experience. It serves as a dynamic showcase
            for an extensive collection of art data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The platform integrates comprehensive details about galleries, artists, genres, and
            paintings, all sourced directly from Supabase. It leverages modern web development
            practices, including RESTful API integration, client-side routing with React Router,
            dynamic state management, and responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Designed with both aesthetics and functionality in mind, the application offers an
            intuitive navigation experience. Users can explore various art categories and easily
            save their favorites for quick access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Developed for COMP 4513 - Web 3, this project also serves as a portfolio piece,

            principles.
